2019 was weird, i just spent time getting the cameraserver to announce properly
also, I did a cursory grip pipeline on the hab targets but we never used it
however, i did switch to the GripPipeline approach and will keep it for 2020

This no longer compiles, but the 2020 version does, so I'll just work with it.
